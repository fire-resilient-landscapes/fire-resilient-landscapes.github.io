They are productive and complex mosaics where communities grow attached to vegetal ecosystems. Regardless, these areas are not considered among risk plans as such but they are associated with either urban or rural areas.
These interfaces have a mixture of housing and productive zones such as forestry. They are called intermixes and they become one of the most fire-prone areas.</description></item></channel></rss>
