This vulnerability may get worse considering their background: being war victims, witnessing guerrillas and fleeing their country.
Despite the inequities they sustain every day, they are one of the most resilient population groups before natural disasters.
According to Maldonado et al., hispanic migrants in the US showed low levels of self-protection and knowledge before disasters like hurricanes and floods, and a lower perception of risk, which makes them more vulnerable than the rest of the population.</description></item></channel></rss>
