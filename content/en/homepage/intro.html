<h1> The Science Behind the Wildfire in Metropolitan Areas </h1>
<br>



<div class="text">
  <p> Annually, forest fires around the world are one of the dangerous
    and unpredictable socio-natural hazards, damaging infrastructure and
    threatening the lives of citizens. One way to reduce uncertainty and
    generate ways to prepare for wildfires is through the use of data,
    geospatial and social sciences. Particularly relevant is the use of
    technologies such as satellite image analysis, machine learning or
    algorithms. Unfortunately, the technical language of these sciences
    does not allow many people to take advantage of these advantages and
    generate better fire prevention strategies.

  <p> Thanks to funding from <b> AGU&copy; Sharing Science 2021</b>,
    this website has been created to <a href="/docs/" class="link">share 6 graphic pieces</a> aimed at
    disseminating scientific advances on forest fires to communities
    in an accessible and dynamic language.  We hope that this page
    will be useful for everyone. Thank you so much for being here.
