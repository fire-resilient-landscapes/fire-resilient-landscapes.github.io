1. Wildfires are naturally caused (e.g. by lightning bolts), and
   human-caused, e.g. with lit cigarette butts carelessly thrown away
   in areas where cities meet rural and industrial zones.

2. The study about wildfires, as broad as it is, considers risk/hazard
   models, fire spread, control and post-disaster recovery.  **Wildfires
   are impossible to predict at the moment**. However, these studies can
   identify fire-prone areas. To do so, they may use: historical data,
   satellite images, machine learning and drone monitoring.

3. Many studies concentrate on understanding biophysical factors that
   make fire more likely to occur, such as: altitude, gradient,
   climatic conditions, solar radiation, wind, drought, and vegetation
   cover.

4. Other studies focus on understanding human factors towards fire,
   such as, institutional governance, prevention/response attitudes of
   the population, economic/social loss and post-fire landscape.
