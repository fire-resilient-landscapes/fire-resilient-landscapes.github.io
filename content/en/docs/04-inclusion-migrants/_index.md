1. Migrants and refugees are considered vulnerable given their scarce
   knowledge of the local language, laws and traditions. This
   vulnerability may get worse considering their background: being war
   victims, witnessing guerrillas and fleeing their country.

2. Despite the inequities they sustain every day, they are one of the
   most resilient population groups before natural disasters.

3. According to Maldonado et al., hispanic migrants in the US showed
   low levels of self-protection and knowledge before disasters like
   hurricanes and floods, and a lower perception of risk, which makes
   them more vulnerable than the rest of the population.

4. In the Philippines, they integrated migrants in disaster risk
   reduction strategies through open data. In other words, they use
   real-time collaboration web pages that offer risk maps and help
   points free of charge.

5. In New Zealand, young refugees from the 2011
   Canterbury earthquake stood out by their abilities to build bridges
   with their community and distribute information about risks and
   disasters in their native language.

6. After the 2017 megafire in the forests of California, the wildfire
   risk planning revealed that it did not consider undocumented
   immigrants who needed federal aid and assistance in Spanish.
