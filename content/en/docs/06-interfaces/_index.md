1. The urban-rural interfaces or Wildland Urban Interface (WUI) are
   border areas between urban and rural land use. They are productive
   and complex mosaics where communities grow attached to vegetal
   ecosystems. Regardless, these areas are not considered among risk
   plans as such but they are associated with either urban or rural
   areas.

2. These interfaces have a mixture of housing and productive zones
   such as forestry. They are called intermixes and they become one of
   the most fire-prone areas.

3. A positive home attachment and participation in local urban
   planning, have proved to be a factor that improves the knowledge
   and preparation before wildfires in the urban-rural
   interfaces. This is particularly practical when using evacuation
   routes.

4. Past experiences of wildfire survival compelled communities to take
   on better preparation and mitigation measures like cleaning
   wastelands.

5. The risk of wildfires in these interfaces can be modelled by
   Machine Learning (ML). In that regard, the computers analyse the
   database of wildfires and satellite imagery of the interfaces and
   learn to assess where they are more likely to occur again.
