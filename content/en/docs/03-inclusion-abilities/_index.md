1. Conscious efforts to include (disabled) people with different
   abilities have not been made in socio-natural disaster risk
   management studies. On top of that, this overlooks the UN mandate
   which states that the nations must have a vision of these risks
   based on human rights.

2. Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 (SFDRR)
   explicitly says that all member nations must incorporate certain
   principles in the planning of prevention measures as well as the
   processes of evacuation: accessibility, inclusion and universal
   design.

3. One way that (disabled) people with different abilities reduce
   their vulnerability before socio-natural disasters, is becoming
   active participants in their own preparation processes, disaster
   risk reduction, disaster response and post-disaster recovery.

4. Not all disasters are the same, therefore, the participation in the
   preparation before disasters of (disabled) people with different
   abilities must be ensured. For example, during 2005 Katrina and
   Rita, the local community networks of deaf people from New Orleans
   proved to be more effective than the aid from federal agencies.

5. Particularly, the Boys, Girls and Adolescents (NNA in Spanish) with
   autism (TEA in Spanish) experience disasters differently and need
   more containment. In the L’Aquila earthquake from 2009, those who
   went through the disaster developed more health issues than those
   who did not.
