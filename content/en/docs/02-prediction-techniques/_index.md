1. Wildfires are difficult to predict without accurate time and space
   information. This issue poses a challenge for countries or
   communities with limited resources and few capable personnel to
   interpret data.

2. In the present, the most used technique to identify fire-prone
   areas is the satellite imagery analysis. These images have been
   obtained since 1970 thanks to softwares like LANDSAT and COPERNICUS
   that take images from space and store them free of charge.
   Additionally, the information that is ultimately analysed comes
   from drones and other Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). These
   vehicles offer a broad vision of the territory, obtain high
   resolution photographs and charge thermal cameras or LIDAR to
   identify radiation emissions.

3. The cloud and MapReduce (a parallel big data processing technique)
   are capable of analysing millions of documents - larger than 1 TB-,
   statistics and images in just a few hours. This technology provides
   a thorough and adaptive fire risk index.  Power transmission lines
   cross zones with extensive vegetation in the wildland-urban
   interface. When these systems fail, they irradiate heat that
   creates conditions for wildfires to occur. The most common failures
   are fallen high voltage electrical conductors, conductors that
   collide with each other and produce a shower of sparks and burning
   products that fall to the ground. We can detect the moment in which
   the transmission systems fail and prevent such events that may
   cause wildfires through an analysis of the shape of the electrical
   waves.

4. One way of predicting where a wildfire will occur, which has been
   worked out through decades, is to investigate the experience of the
   people who inhabit affected territories. We can retrieve five types
   of relevant historical data through surveys and interviews: 
   1. Subjective and advanced wildfire knowledge, (2) self-reported
   perceptions, (3) level of information, (4) self-protection
   measures, and (5) the importance of community involvement.
