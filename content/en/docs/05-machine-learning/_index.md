1. Machine Learning (ML) is how computers learn based on a large
   amount of data. However, they will be able to predict fire-prone
   areas as long as they obtain more accurate data and there is a
   strong investment in this technology.

2. Human-caused wildfires may be assessed by ML given the large amount
   of satellite and statistical information from the past. One of the
   most accurate ML is Random Forest.

3. Wildfires caused by power transmission failures may also be
   assessed using the Hybrid Step XGBoost model which teaches the
   computers to create warnings in real time and avoid false alarms
   with a 98.17% accuracy.

4. Likewise, ML helps to create wildfire susceptibility maps, in other
   words, maps that measure the possibility of fire occurrence in a
   region considering their conditioning geophysical and human
   factors.

5. Google Earth Engine platform provides a solid ground for public
   access ML and allows the creation of easy-to-understand decision
   models. For example, the most important variables to detect
   wildfires (soil moisture, temperature and drought) were discovered
   in Australia thanks to the Google Earth Engine platform.

6. The ML based on data that combine satellite observations and
   temporary statistics obtain better accuracy percentages (between 80
   and 95%). Since the data are more reliable, professionals capable
   of understanding these processes in fire-prone areas will be
   needed.
